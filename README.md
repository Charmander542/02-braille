## Overview
A refreshable Braille device is one in which the Braille surface can be dynamically changed, for example, to render a different page of text. This project proposes to design and build an affordable, Kindle-like product for blind users that uses Braille to display text and store books. The goal is to significantly reduce cost compared to existing devices while maintaining usability, reliability, and accessibility.

## Scope and Key Components
- PCB design
- Embedded firmware development
- Software for content ingestion, storage, and user interface
- Sensors and actuators; possibly pneumatics or microfluidics for tactile actuation
- Housing and industrial design
- Power management

## Prior Work and Motivation
Prior work on this type of device exists; however, it is typically very expensive. We seek to create an affordable device that would render pages of text. We are prepared to seek input from local organizations that support persons who use Braille.
